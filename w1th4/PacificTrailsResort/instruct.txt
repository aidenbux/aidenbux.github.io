Step 1: Modify the Pacific Trails Resort WebsiteStep 1: Modify the Pacific Trails Resort Website
Attached Files:
File Step1-Update.zip (911.753 KB)

<div> tags to define the HTML framework is a blast from the past circa 1993. 
HTML5, released in 2014, semantic tags <header>, <main>, <nav>, <footer>, etc. are the name of the game NOW!

Professional Practices: Without explicit instructions, students should now know to:
Organize the website into folders (images, css, etc. as practiced in SWDV130)
Add meta tags (description, author, etc.) as practiced in SWDV130
Add alt tags on images for SEO as practiced in SWDV130
Add a student name comment to BOTH the HTML/CSS files as practiced in SWDV130
